      <p>One of Hannah's favorite hobbies is softball.
        She has been playing softball since she was five or six years old and has loved it ever since.
        Growing up, she played for numerous different teams and several different levels.
        Instead of softball being a summer sport for her, she extended it to year-round, whether it was simply training she did in the winter or traveling south to play in tournaments.
         She currently plays for Dakota State University during the school year and for a hometown team during the summers.
         While at school, Hannah’s primary position is 3rd base; however, when she plays at her hometown team, she can be seen in various positions, including catcher and 2nd base.
         She is entering her senior year at Dakota State University and hopes to make it her best year. </p>
